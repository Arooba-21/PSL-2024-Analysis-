# PSL-2024-Analysis-
This is a Jupyter Notebook project where I explore data from the Pakistan Super League (PSL). It includes analysis of teams, run scores, and bowlers using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

🏏 PSL Season 9 – Data Analysis with Python

This project uses Python and Jupyter Notebook to analyze ball-by-ball data from **PSL Season 9**. It focuses on cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and visualizing top-performing batters and bowlers using charts and heatmaps.

🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

* `pandas` for data manipulation
* `matplotlib` & `seaborn` for data visualization
* `Jupyter Notebook` for analysis

 📊 Key Analysis Performed

Data Cleaning:

  * Handled missing values in columns like `wides`, `noballs`, `byes`, `legbyes`, `penalty`, `wicket_type`, and dismissed player fields.
  
Top Players:

  * Identified top 10 run-scorers
  * Identified top 10 wicket-takers
  * Found most frequent players who hit sixes and fours
  * Analyzed most common wicket types using a heatmap

📈 Sample Visualizations

* Bar chart of **Top 10 Batters** by total runs
* Bar chart of **Top 10 Bowlers** by wickets
* Heatmap showing count of different **wicket types**

📌 How to Run
